How to run with Visual Studio and Docker Desktop:
1) Build the Container Images: docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache
2) Create the containers: docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --no-build

Expected result:

After that, the containers will run on their own. The test containers will display the expected print messages.
Meanwhile the main server will remain open. So the only thing missing are the main clients.
 
3) Open a new terminal to run multiple clients
4) Inside the new terminal run the following commands:
    - docker ps: This command displays all important information involving the main_client containers
    - From the container's info we get the id and then execute docker exec -it <container's id> /bin/bash
    - Type ls -la and find the build folder
    - Enter the build with cd build
    - Type ls -la again to find ther main_client file
    - After that simply run the client (./main_client main-server 8080)

5) Use multiple terminals to create multiple clients connected to the same server
6) Enjoy texting
